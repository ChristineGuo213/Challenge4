# Risk Return Analysis

This is a python command-line interface application that aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. The application works by taking in DataFrame from 'whale_navs.csv' and evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. The platform determines the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas. It then makes a recommendation on a fund that works best with client's investment objectives.

* [%matplotlib inline](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html) - Tells Jupyter to create the plot inline with the code in the notebook.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Used for numerical computing tools
